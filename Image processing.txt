2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Description: Extract text from images using OCR techniques.
Goal: Learn text detection and recognition using machine learning.
Tools: Tesseract OCR with OpenCV for preprocessing.
Steps:
Preprocess the image (e.g., thresholding, noise reduction).
Use Tesseract to detect and extract text.
Post-process results for better accuracy.
